    <h1>Math functions and es6 features</h1>
    <h4>Q1.Write a function that uses Math.min() and Math.max() to limit a number within a given range (e.g., between 1 and 10).</h4>
    <h4>Q2.What result would you get from Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 5, and what range does this expression cover?</h4>
    <h4>Q3.If you wanted to round a number up to the nearest integer only if it has a fractional part (e.g., 5.1 to 6 but 5.0 remains 5), which function(s) could you use?</h4>
   
    
<h2>destructutring:--</h2>
<h4>Q4.How would you use destructuring to assign the first two elements of an array [10, 20, 30, 40] to variables a and b?</h4>
<h4>Q5.Given an object { name: "Alice", age: 25, city: "New York" }, how would you use destructuring to assign name and age to variables?</h4>
<h4>Q6.Using nested destructuring, how would you extract the city property from this object: { person: { name: "Eve", address: { city: "Paris" } } }?</h4>

<h2>Rest and spread operators:--</h2>
<h4>Q7.How would you use the spread operator to combine two arrays, [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5, 6], into a single array?</h4>
<h4>Q8.Given the function function sum(...numbers) {}, explain how the rest operator can be used in this function to calculate the sum of an arbitrary number of arguments.</h4>
<h4>Q9.How can you use the spread operator to clone an object { name: "John", age: 30 } into a new object with an additional city property?</h4>
